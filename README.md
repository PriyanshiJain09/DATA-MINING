# DATA-MINING

Practical1 - Apply data cleaning techniques on any dataset (e,g, wine dataset). Techniques may include handling missing values, outliers, inconsistent values. A set of validation rules can be prepared based on the dataset and validations can be performed.

Practical2 - Apply data pre-processing techniques such as standardization/normalization, transformation, aggregation, discretization/binarization, sampling etc. on any dataset.

Practical3 - Run Apriori algorithm to find frequent item sets and association rules on 2 real datasets and use appropriate evaluation measures to compute correctness of obtained patterns
a) Use minimum support as 50% and minimum confidence as 75%
b) Use minimum support as 60% and minimum confidence as 60 %

Practical4 - Use Naive bayes, K-nearest, and Decision tree classification algorithms and build classifiers on any two datasets. Divide the data set into training and test set. Compare the accuracy of the different classifiers under the following situations:
I. a) Training set = 75% Test set = 25% b) Training set = 66.6% (2/3rd of total), Test set = 33.3%
II. Training set is chosen by i) hold out method ii) Random subsampling iii) Cross-Validation. 
Compare the accuracy of the classifiers obtained. Data needs to be scaled to standard format.

Practical5 - Use Simple K-means algorithm for clustering on any dataset. Compare the performance of clusters by changing the parameters involved in the algorithm. Plot MSE computed after each iteration using a line plot for any set of parameters.
